  This library uses Timer2 to drive up to 8 servos using interrupts so no refresh activity is required from within the sketch.
  The usage and method naming is similar to the Arduino software servo library http://www.arduino.cc/playground/ComponentLib/Servo
  except that pulse widths can be in microseconds or degrees.
  write() treats parameters of 180 or less as degrees, otherwise values are milliseconds.

  A servo is activated by creating an instance of the Servo class passing the desired pin to the attach() method.
  The servo is pulsed in the background to the value most recently written using the write() method

  Note that analogWrite of PWM on pins 3 and 11 is disabled when the first servo is attached
